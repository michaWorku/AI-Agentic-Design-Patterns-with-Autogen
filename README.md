# AI Agentic Design Patterns with AutoGen


## ðŸ“˜ Course Overview

[**AI Agentic Design Patterns with AutoGen**](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/ai-agentic-design-patterns-with-autogen/) is a hands-on course designed by DeepLearning.AI to teach developers and AI practitioners how to design and implement **multi-agent systems** using the **AutoGen** framework. The course explores collaborative AI patterns such as tool use, planning, reflection, and conversation orchestration across real-world use cases like customer onboarding, blog writing, financial analysis, and more.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### 1. **Environment Setup**
- Ensure Python 3.9+ is installed.
- Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install autogen openai matplotlib yfinance python-chess
```

### 2. **API Configuration**
- Set your OpenAI API key:
```python
from autogen import get_openai_api_key
get_openai_api_key()
```

### 3. **Run Notebooks**
- Open the desired notebook in Jupyter or VS Code.
- Execute cells sequentially to simulate agent interactions.

## ðŸ›  Helpers & Utils

Some lessons include predefined helper functions for enhanced code execution:

- `get_stock_prices(ticker, period)`: Fetches historical closing prices using `yfinance`.
- `plot_stock_prices(data, output_path)`: Plots and saves visualizations using `matplotlib`.
- `get_legal_moves()`, `make_move(move)`: Chess logic tools for move validation and board updates.

These helpers are **injected into the code execution environment** for better modularity, reducing LLM errors and increasing execution consistency.


Enjoy building powerful agentic workflows with **AutoGen**!
