      "It appears there was an issue retrieving the stock price data for the tickers 'NVDA' and 'TSLA'. The error messages suggest that there was no response or potentially incorrect or outdated ticker symbols.\n",
      "\n",
      "To resolve this, I suggest the following steps:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Double-check that the ticker symbols 'NVDA' and 'TSLA' are correctly provided and that they are currently listed on the stock exchange.\n",
      "2. Verify network connectivity since a failure to retrieve data could sometimes be network-related.\n",
      "3. Ensure that the data source the function `get_stock_prices` relies on is currently operational and that you have the necessary access permissions or APIs needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since these checks and verifications generally fall beyond the script's control and the error seems related to the data source or API, you might want to contact your system administrator or data provider for more information.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unfortunately, without access to valid data, we cannot proceed with creating the plot. If you can resolve the data access issue or if there's another way to source the data, we can continue with the plot creation. \n",

      "Please let me know if there's anything else I can assist you with or if you manage to resolve the data access issue, and we can reattempt the plotting.\n",
