      "\n",
      "1. **Retrieve Historical Stock Prices**: Fetch the daily closing stock prices of Nvidia (ticker symbol: NVDA) from March 23, 2024, to April 23, 2024. You can use financial data APIs like Yahoo Finance along with Python libraries such as `pandas` and `yfinance` to achieve this.\n",

This will help in understanding the trends and significant movements in the stock price.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Contextual Information and Market Events**: Gather information about any company-specific news or global economic events during this period that might have influenced stock prices. For instance, earnings reports, significant corporate announcements, or broader market conditions. \n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Compare with Market Performance**: To give additional depth, you might want to compare Nvidia's performance with the overall market or similar companies in the tech sector. This can be done by looking at indices like the S&P 500 or the NASDAQ.\n",

      "\n",
      "1. **Retrieve Historical Stock Prices**: Fetch the daily closing stock prices of Nvidia (ticker symbol: NVDA) from March 23, 2024, to April 23, 2024. You can use financial data APIs like Yahoo Finance along with Python libraries such as `pandas` and `yfinance` to achieve this.\n",
      "   \n",
      "2. **Analyze Stock Price Trends**: Calculate statistical metrics like the highest price, the lowest price, average price, median price, and any significant daily percentage changes within the time frame. This will help in understanding the trends and significant movements in the stock price.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Contextual Information and Market Events**: Gather information about any company-specific news or global economic events during this period that might have influenced stock prices. For instance, earnings reports, significant corporate announcements, or broader market conditions. \n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Compare with Market Performance**: To give additional depth, you might want to compare Nvidia's performance with the overall market or similar companies in the tech sector. This can be done by looking at indices like the S&P 500 or the NASDAQ.\n",
